# Vertical-Handoff
This simulator is explained in our paper "Improving Vertical Handoffs Using Mobility Prediction" - DOI: 10.14569/IJACSA.2016.070356

Short Discription:

In this work, we provide a GUI to generate a network for MANETs, refer to paper for details. We use Markov Model to learn and predict the future movements of moving mobile nodes. All of these parameters can be reset through the GUI we prvide in this code. The Markov model we use in the code is 1st order. In the paper we used higher orders and this code can be changed to support higher order MM to acheive higher prediction accuracies.
